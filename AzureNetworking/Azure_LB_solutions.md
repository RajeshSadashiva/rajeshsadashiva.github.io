# Azure Load Balancing Solutions: A Comprehensive Overview

Azure offers a comprehensive suite of load balancing solutions, each designed for different scenarios and layers of the OSI model. Understanding their differences is crucial for choosing the right one for your application.

This README provides a detailed breakdown of the main Azure load balancing solutions and their key distinctions.

---

## 1. Azure Load Balancer

* **Layer**: **Layer 4** (Transport Layer - TCP/UDP)
* **Scope**: **Regional** (within a single Azure region) or **Global** (Standard SKU can support cross-region, but primarily for distributing traffic to regional backends)
* **Traffic Type**: Non-HTTP(S) traffic (e.g., TCP, UDP, SMTP, RDP)
* **Key Features**:
    * **Basic Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming traffic to healthy backend instances based on a 5-tuple hash (Source IP, Source Port, Destination IP, Destination Port, Protocol).
    * **Health Probes**: Monitors the health of backend instances and takes unhealthy ones out of rotation.
    * **Public and Internal**: Can be configured as a public-facing load balancer for internet traffic or an internal load balancer for traffic within a virtual network.
    * **SKUs**:
        * **Basic**: Simpler, limited features, lower scale, generally for non-production environments.
        * **Standard**: More robust, higher scale, zone-redundant, and supports availability zones. Recommended for production.
        * **Gateway**: Specifically designed for service chaining with virtual appliances (e.g., firewalls, NVA).
* **When to use**: When you need basic, low-latency load balancing for non-HTTP(S) traffic within a virtual network or across zones in a region.

## 2. Azure Application Gateway

* **Layer**: **Layer 7** (Application Layer - HTTP/HTTPS)
* **Scope**: **Regional** (within a single Azure region)
* **Traffic Type**: HTTP(S) traffic
* **Key Features**:
    * **URL Path-Based Routing**: Routes requests to different backend pools based on the URL path.
    * **Host-Based Routing**: Routes requests based on the host header (multiple websites on a single Application Gateway).
    * **SSL/TLS Termination (SSL Offloading)**: Decrypts incoming HTTPS traffic at the Application Gateway, reducing the load on backend servers. It can also re-encrypt for end-to-end SSL.
    * **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Provides centralized protection for web applications against common exploits and vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting) using OWASP rulesets.
    * **Session Affinity (Cookie-Based)**: Directs subsequent requests from the same client to the same backend server.
    * **Autoscaling**: Automatically scales based on traffic load.
    * **Rewrites**: Modifies HTTP headers and URLs.
* **When to use**: When you need advanced, application-layer load balancing for web applications within a region, including SSL offloading, WAF protection, and intelligent routing based on HTTP attributes.

## 3. Azure Front Door

* **Layer**: **Layer 7** (Application Layer - HTTP/HTTPS)
* **Scope**: **Global** (distributes traffic across multiple Azure regions and even hybrid environments)
* **Traffic Type**: HTTP(S) traffic
* **Key Features**:
    * **Global Traffic Routing**: Routes user requests to the closest available backend based on performance, priority, or geographical routing methods, leveraging Microsoft's global edge network.
    * **Anycast**: Directs clients to the nearest Front Door point of presence (PoP), reducing latency.
    * **SSL/TLS Termination**: Provides SSL offloading at the edge.
    * **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Integrated WAF for global protection against web attacks.
    * **Caching**: Caches static content at the edge to improve performance.
    * **URL-based Routing & Rewriting**: Similar to Application Gateway but at a global scale.
    * **Session Affinity**: Can maintain session affinity at a global level.
* **When to use**: When you need to build highly available and scalable global web applications, requiring low-latency content delivery, WAF protection, and intelligent routing across multiple regions. It's ideal for distributing traffic across application "stamps" or deployments in different geographies.

## 4. Azure Traffic Manager

* **Layer**: **DNS-based** (operates at the DNS level, not directly on the network traffic)
* **Scope**: **Global** (distributes traffic across multiple Azure regions or external endpoints)
* **Traffic Type**: Protocol-agnostic (can direct traffic for any protocol, but it's not a proxy; it simply manipulates DNS)
* **Key Features**:
    * **DNS-based Routing**: Directs clients to the appropriate service endpoint by returning the IP address of the chosen endpoint in response to DNS queries.
    * **Traffic Routing Methods**: Supports various methods like:
        * **Priority**: Routes all traffic to a primary endpoint, with failover to secondary endpoints if the primary is unhealthy.
        * **Weighted**: Distributes traffic based on assigned weights.
        * **Performance**: Routes clients to the endpoint with the lowest latency from their location.
        * **Geographic**: Routes users to specific endpoints based on their geographic location.
        * **Multivalue**: Returns multiple healthy endpoints in a single DNS response.
        * **Subnet**: Routes traffic based on the client's IP subnet.
    * **Endpoint Monitoring**: Continuously monitors the health of configured endpoints.
* **When to use**: When you need to distribute traffic globally across multiple endpoints (which can be Azure services, on-premises datacenters, or other cloud providers) for improved performance, availability, or disaster recovery. It's often used in conjunction with regional load balancers like Application Gateway or Azure Load Balancer.
